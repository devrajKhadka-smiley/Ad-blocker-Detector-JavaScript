This Project is just a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Work but hold the crucial understanding of web page loading and Web Scripting. 


# What and How Ad Blocker Work
Technically, ad blockers do not block ads directly. Instead, they block web requests that would otherwise download content into the browser. In simpler terms, ad blockers prevent advertisements from being downloaded to your browser, thereby speeding up web page loading times and enhancing the browsing experience.

AdBlock technology relies on straightforward lists known as filter lists, which dictate what content to block or allow on the web pages you visit. These lists contain URLs categorized either as an "allowlist" or "blocklist". When you visit a website, AdBlock quickly checks if that site is listed in these filters. If it is, any request for external content is blocked, preventing ads from being downloaded onto the webpage. In essence, AdBlock operates based on predefined rules within these filter lists to determine what should be blocked or permitted while browsing the web.
